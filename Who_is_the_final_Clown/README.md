# Who is the Final Clown

This small project is a playful, classroom exercise that recreates a party-style "truth-or-dare" selection mechanic: players take turns, and when someone is chosen to be the "final clown" they must accept a light-hearted penalty (a dare, a small performance, or a silly task).

The idea for this exercise came from social gatherings â€” specifically the classic party game where a selected person must perform a challenge or receive a friendly punishment. The implementation here is intentionally simple and made for learning: it focuses on game flow, UI, and event handling rather than complex graphics or networking.

## Purpose

- Educational: a short assignment for a class on interactive experiences.
- Practice: implementing selection logic, state management, and simple animations or feedback.
- Fun: a light, social mechanic inspired by truth-or-dare games played at parties.

## How it works

- Players are listed and a selection mechanism (random pick / wheel / countdown) determines who is chosen.
- The chosen player is marked the "final clown" and the UI prompts for a punishment (dare) or an action to complete.
- After the action is completed or skipped, the game can continue or end.

## Run

This project is intentionally standalone. Run the main script from the repo root (if present):

```bash
python Who_is_the_final_Clown/10_clown_game.py
```

(You may need to use the repo virtualenv to satisfy any dependencies.)

## Classroom note

This project was created as a short in-class exercise. It was inspired by social party games where people take turns and the group playfully selects someone for a small challenge. The goal was to learn event-driven programming and UI feedback while keeping the concept familiar and relatable.
